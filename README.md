# Predicting_Bike_Sharing_Patterns
This project is developed as a coursework for 'Deep Learning Nanodegree' at Udacity. It takes data from [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) and the goal was to build and train Neural Network to predict the number of bikeshare users.
